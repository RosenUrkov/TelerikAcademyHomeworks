Bugs:

#1 - ModelsFactory - CreateUser() - username and email passed to user constructor was swapped
#2 - Task - ToString() - owner is not printed
#3 - CommandsFactory - CreateCommandFromString() - create user command case is missing
#4 - FileLogger - Error() - method was commented


Bottleneck:

#1 CommandFactory -> BuildCommand - pointless operations and cycling
